~ always use shorthand e.g. v-bind as just :, v-on as just @
    <button :class="buttonClasses" @click="toggle">Click Me</button>

~ looping, always use a unique key, also put attributes on their own line
    <li
            v-for="assignment in assignments.filter(a => !a.complete)"
            :key="assignment.id"
    >
~ v-show doesn't completely remove html, just sets display to none
    <section class="mt-8" v-show="assignments.filter(a => a.complete).length">
